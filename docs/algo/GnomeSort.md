# Gnome Sort

Gnome Sort, also known as Stupid Sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to insertion sort but moves elements to their proper position by a series of swaps, similar to how a gnome sorts his flower pots. For more details on the algorithm and its theory, see the [Gnome Sort Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort).

Note: While Gnome Sort has O(n) complexity in the best case when the input is already sorted, it degrades to O(nÂ²) in average and worst cases. Its main advantages are its simplicity and the fact that it only uses a single temporary variable for swapping.
