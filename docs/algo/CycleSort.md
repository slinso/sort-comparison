# Cycle Sort

Cycle Sort is an in-place, unstable sorting algorithm that is theoretically optimal in terms of the number of memory writes. It works by cycling through each element and placing it in its correct position, creating a series of cyclic rotations. For more details on the algorithm and its theory, see the [Cycle Sort Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sort).

Note: While Cycle Sort minimizes the number of memory writes, its O(nÂ²) time complexity makes it primarily useful for situations where write operations are significantly more expensive than read operations or where minimal memory writes are crucial.
